E-Commerce Microservices Platform ("ShopCloud")
This is a classic but perfect example that allows you to implement almost all major Spring Cloud features. You'll build a simplified version of an online store backend.

1. System Architecture & Microservices Breakdown
   You will create several independent services that work together.

text
[Web/Mobile App] --> [API Gateway] --> [Microservices]
|--> [Service Discovery]
|--> [Config Server]
Core Microservices:

API Gateway Service: The single entry point for all client requests.

Service Discovery Server (Eureka): Keeps track of all service instances.

Config Server: Centralized management of configuration for all services.

Product Service: Handles product catalog (CRUD operations, get products by category, etc.).

Order Service: Handles order processing (create order, get order history).

Inventory Service: Manages stock levels.

User (Auth) Service: Handles user registration, login, and JWT token generation.

(Optional Advanced Services):

Notification Service: Sends emails/notifications (using Kafka/RabbitMQ for async processing).

Payment Service: Simulates a payment process.

Rating & Reviews Service: Handles product reviews.

2. Spring Cloud Technologies You Will Use
   This is the core of your learning experience.

Technology	Purpose in "ShopCloud"	Spring Cloud Component
Spring Cloud Gateway / Netflix Zuul	API Gateway for routing, filtering, cross-cutting concerns (auth, logging).	spring-cloud-starter-gateway
Netflix Eureka	Service Discovery. All services register here. The Gateway finds service URLs through Eureka.	spring-cloud-starter-netflix-eureka-server / client
Spring Cloud Config	Centralized config. Database URLs, feature flags, etc., are stored in a Git repository.	spring-cloud-config-server
OpenFeign	Declarative REST client. The Order Service will use Feign to call the Product and Inventory services.	spring-cloud-starter-openfeign
Resilience4j	Circuit Breaker & Retry. If the Inventory Service is down, the Order Service won't get stuck.	spring-cloud-starter-circuitbreaker-resilience4j
Spring Boot Actuator	Provides health checks, metrics, and monitoring endpoints for each service.	spring-boot-starter-actuator
Spring Security & JWT	Secure APIs and implement token-based authentication.	spring-boot-starter-security
Spring Cloud Sleuth & Zipkin	Distributed Tracing. Track a single request as it journeys through all microservices.	spring-cloud-starter-sleuth, spring-cloud-sleuth-zipkin
RabbitMQ / Kafka	For asynchronous communication (e.g., order placed -> send confirmation email).	spring-boot-starter-amqp
3. Sample Interaction Flow: "Placing an Order"
   This demonstrates how the services collaborate.

Client sends a POST /api/order request with a JWT token and order details to the API Gateway.

API Gateway validates the JWT token (possibly by talking to the Auth Service).

The Gateway consults Eureka to find the network location of the Order Service.

The request is routed to the Order Service.

Order Service receives the request.

It uses Feign to call the Product Service (via Eureka) to get product details and prices.

It uses Feign to call the Inventory Service to check and reserve stock.

This Feign call is wrapped in a Resilience4j Circuit Breaker to handle timeouts or failures gracefully.

If all steps are successful, the Order Service saves the order to its database.

The Order Service publishes an OrderPlacedEvent message to RabbitMQ.

The Notification Service (subscribed to the queue) consumes the message and sends a "Order Confirmed" email to the user.

The Order Service sends a response back to the client through the Gateway.

4. Project Structure (Simplified)
   Your workspace (ShopCloud) would contain multiple modules.

text
shopcloud/
├── config-server/                 # Spring Cloud Config Server
├── service-discovery/             # Netflix Eureka Server
├── api-gateway/                   # Spring Cloud Gateway
├── product-service/
├── order-service/
├── inventory-service/
├── user-service/
└── notification-service/ (optional)
Each service is its own independent Spring Boot project with its own application.yml and pom.xml (or build.gradle).

5. How to Get Started (Step-by-Step)
   Initialize: Use Spring Initializr to create each service. Select the required dependencies for each.

Service Discovery: Set up the Eureka Server first. All other services will be its clients.

Config Server: Set it up next and move all database and other configurations from application.properties to a Git repo.

API Gateway: Implement basic routing rules (e.g., /api/product/** -> product-service).

Build Core Services: Start with Product and User services. They are simpler.

Implement Communication: Build the Order Service and use OpenFeign to call other services.

Add Resilience: Wrap your Feign clients with Resilience4j circuit breakers.

Add Security: Implement JWT-based security in the Gateway and individual services.

Containerize (Bonus): Create a Dockerfile for each service and use docker-compose.yml to run the entire ecosystem with one command.

This project will give you immensely valuable, industry-relevant experience with the entire Spring Cloud suite. You can start simple and add more complex features (like distributed transactions with Saga pattern, monitoring with Prometheus/Grafana, etc.) as you get comfortable.
